#Notes
##Log during publishing the app
Uploading JavaScript bundles
ðŸš€ It looks like this your first Android publish for this project! We've automatically set some configuration values in AndroidManifest.xml. You'll need to make and release a new build before your users can download the update you just published.


##Snack problems
1. screens/HomeScreen.js (65:6): 
React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'favorite.id' and 'isFavorite'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. (react-hooks/exhaustive-deps)
(ESLint)

2. components/FavoriteButton.js (23:6)
React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'favorite.id' and 'isFavorite'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. (react-hooks/exhaustive-deps)
